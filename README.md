# MODEL_COMPARISON

This repository supports **Deliverable 5.2.1 & 5.3.1** of the Marine Microgrid project, focused on evaluating dynamic models of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices and their integration into power systems.

The goal of this deliverable is to compare our developed dynamic WEC model (in simulink) behavior/performance in different simulation environments such as:
- **Simulink**
- **PowerFactory**
- **PowerDynamics.jl**

## What's in this repo?

- 📁 `Data/`: Simulation data (processed and raw)
- 📁 `Figs/`: Figures used in the report
- 📄 `analysis.ipynb`: Main comparison notebook (plots voltage/current)
- 📄 `main.tex`: Draft report (LaTeX)
- 📄 `main.pdf`: Compiled report
- 📄 `README.md`: You're here!
